SystemC-based simulation of a hardware system, composed of four key hardware components:
1. CPU â€“ controls the system.
2. Sensor â€“ provides random data.
3. Memory â€“ stores data.
4. Actuator â€“ performs an action based on input.
These components are connected via a Bus that routes communication between them using memory-mapped I/O.

System Flow Summary: 
1. Sensor generates a random number every 5ns.
2. CPU reads this value every 10ns from address 0x10.
3. The value is:
  3.1 Written to memory at 0x20
  3.2 Used to decide whether the actuator should be turned on (1) or off (0)
4. The bus routes the read/write requests from the CPU to the correct devices.

Mail for addresses 0x10â€“0x1F â†’ goes to the Sensor
Mail for addresses 0x20â€“0x2F â†’ goes to the Memory
Mail for addresses 0x30â€“0x3F â†’ goes to the Actuator

The CPU doesnâ€™t know what device it's talking to â€” just the address
The bus translates addresses into device actions. The bus sees the devices at 0x10, 0x20, and 0x30.
Each device in your simulation has its own internal address space of size 16 bytes (0x10), but they are exposed to the CPU through different bus addresses.

Example:
But each device only uses 16 bytes internally.
The CPU might write to 0x22, and the bus will:
Recognize it's in the range 0x20â€“0x2F â†’ go to memory
Forward 0x22 - 0x20 = 0x02 as the internal address to memory.write(0x02, data)


ðŸ§  Logical Sequence Every 10ns
Every 10 nanoseconds:
1. Sensor â†’ Bus â†’ CPU
  Sensor generates a new random number (0â€“99).
  CPU reads this value via the bus from address 0x10.
2. CPU â†’ Bus â†’ Memory
  CPU writes the value to address 0x20 (mapped to Memory).
  Bus routes this to memory.write(offset, val).
  CPU â†’ Bus â†’ Actuator
3. CPU checks if the value > 50.
  Writes 1 (turn on) or 0 (turn off) to 0x30 (mapped to Actuator).
  Actuator updates its internal state and prints a message.
